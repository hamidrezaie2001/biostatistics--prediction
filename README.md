# biostatistics--prediction

In this project, we are going to have a brief and elementary hands-on real-world project, predicting breast cancer survival using machine learning models with clinical data and gene expression profiles.

This project aims to predict breast cancer using several machine-learning classification models. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset from the UCI repository contains features extracted from digitized images of breast cell nuclei.

Key techniques employed include data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and cross-validation to combat overfitting. Visualizations including correlation plots and confusion matrices provide additional insight into model performance.
